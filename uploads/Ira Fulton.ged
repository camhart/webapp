2 CONC e very early Planters (settlers) who founded Jamestown, Virginia, the f
2 CONC irst permanent English settlement in North America.  He was also the fi
2 CONC rst known person named Graves in North America."  [cites "Records of th
2 CONC e Virginia Company of London," vol. IV, p. 364]...
2 CONT      "King James I of England, on April 10, 1606, granted letters paten
2 CONC t (charter) to Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Richard Hakluyt, Ed
2 CONC ward-Maria Winfield, Thomas Hanham, Raleigh Gilbert, William Parker, an
2 CONC d George Popham, in whose names the petition for the charter to the Vir
2 CONC ginia Company of London had been made, for the founding of two colonies i
2 CONC n Virginia....
2 CONT      "Capt. Newport left England in the Mary and Margaret, a ship of ab
2 CONC out 150 tons, with the second supply, probably in August of 1608.  Many s
2 CONC ources give the arrival date of this second supply as being early in Oc
2 CONC tober 1608.  We do know that it was after Sept. 10, 1608.
2 CONT      "A comparatively complete record, with the names, of the little ba
2 CONC nd of first planters who came in 1607 and the two supplies of 1608 is g
2 CONC iven by Captain John Smith in his Historie.  These three expeditions br
2 CONC ought a total of about 295 people--the first settlers numbering about 1
2 CONC 05, the first supply 120, and the second supply about 70.  Of the whole n
2 CONC umber, 92 are described as 'gentlemen.'
2 CONT      "Regarding the title of 'Captain' which is attached to Thomas Grav
2 CONC es in Virginia historical records, he had no such designation in the Ch
2 CONC arter of 1609 wherein all the Adventurers (stockholders) of the Virgini
2 CONC a Company are listed, and is shown by Captain John Smith on his arrival i
2 CONC n Virginia simply as 'Thomas Graves, Gent.'  Thus it appears that he ac
2 CONC quired the title of Captain after arriving in Virginia.
2 CONT      "Thomas Graves early became active in the affairs of the infant co
2 CONC lony.  On an exploring expedition he was captured by the Indians and ta
2 CONC ken to Opechancanough.  Thomas Savage, who had come to Virginia with th
2 CONC e first supply on the John and Francis in 1608, was sent to rescue him, i
2 CONC n which he was successful.
2 CONT      "The winter of 1608-09 was much better than the previous winter, b
2 CONC ut soon after Capt. John Smith returned to England for medical treatmen
2 CONC t in October 1609, the 'Starving Time' reduced the population of about 5
2 CONC 00 to no more than sixty men, women, and children.  In June of 1610, th
2 CONC e survivors were in the process of abandoning the settlement, when Lord D
2 CONC elaware arrived as governor of the colony.  From that time on, there wa
2 CONC s apparently no further serious thought of abandoning the town.  Howeve
2 CONC r, even by 1616, the colony had a total population of only 351, of whom 8
2 CONC 1 were farmers or tenants.
2 CONT      "In 1617 the Virginia Company, hoping to expand population and agr
2 CONC icultural production in the colony, encouraged private or voluntary ass
2 CONC ociations organized on a joint stock basis to establish settlements in t
2 CONC he area of the Company's patent.  The Society of Smith's (or Smythe's) H
2 CONC undred (later called Southampton Hundred) was organized in 1617.  In ad
2 CONC dition to Captain Thomas Graves, the Adventurers included Sir Thomas Sm
2 CONC ith, Sir Edwin Sandys, and the Earl of Southampton.  Soon after April 2

2 CONT Ibid:  "In addition to the proven children of Henry [superscript 5] Gra
2 CONC ves of Hanover Co., Mrs. Hiden believed he had yet another son whose wi
2 CONC dow, Elizabeth, was the grantor in the following deed (see p. 264, R-52
2 CONC 4).
2 CONT       In Mecklenberg D.B. 2, p. 4, on May 10, 1767, Elizabeth Graves of S
2 CONC t. James Parish of said
2 CONT county, for love and affection, bound herself in the penalty of double t

2 CONC reparatory to a second marriage.  In 1779 (Lunenburg D.B. 13, p. 206), A

1 NOTE The following is from an article entitled 'Captain James Friend
2 CONT and his Company at Battle of Point Pleasant on 10 October 1774'
2 CONT by Warren Skidmore obtained from the Allegheny Regional Family
2 CONT History Society, PO Box 1804, Elkins, WV 20241:
2 CONT
2 CONT Benjamin Cleaver is the eldest son by William Cleaver's first
2 CONT wife. He moved to what is now Nelson Co, KY in the summer
2 CONT of 1779 where he later entered land on Beech Fork. In 1782
2 CONT Benjamin Cleaver and his brother William Cleaver, Junior (who
2 CONT married Susannah, dauighter of Daniel Westfall), volunteered in
2 CONT Captain James Davis' company for the expedition against the
2 CONT northern Indians (Shawnees) and marched towards Detroit.
2 CONT William, in his pension application, says that Benjamin Cleaver
2 CONT was wounded and that they were both taken prisoners by the
2 CONT Indians and detained by them for six months. Benjamin died in
2 CONT Grayson Co, Kentucky soon after 27 May 1833 when he gave an
2 CONT affidavit taken at Leitchfield about his brother's service in
2 CONT the Revolution

2 CONT Francis Lindsley was born in England, and from the deeds ofhis lands gi
2 CONC ven to his sons in 1704, probably died shortlyafter. In an old family b
2 CONC ible (which formerly belonged toMrs. Elizabeth Lindsley Shaw) in Morris
2 CONC town, is found thisitem: 'Fra n cis Lindsley came to this country from E
2 CONC nglandin the ship with Robert Kitchell in 1639, this ship said tohave b
2 CONC een the first to anchor in New Haven Bay.' TheCollections of the New Je
2 CONC rsey Historical Society, Suplement,Vol. 6, p.122 states th a t Robert K
2 CONC itchell left England onApril 26, 1639, and came to New Haven with the R
2 CONC everendHenry Whitfield and others. On shipboard or upon landing,they dr
2 CONC ew up and signed a plantation covenant, to which theyall subscribed, ".
2 CONC ..intending by God ' s gracious permissionto plant themselves in new En
2 CONC gland, and we will, the Lordassisting, sit down and join ourselves toge
2 CONC ther in onecertain Plantation." This was the company in which FrancisLi
2 CONC nlie and his brother, John, arrived in New Haven.
2 CONT The first authentic data of Francis Lindsley's life in NewHaven is foun
2 CONC d in "The Record of the Colony of New Haven,"Vol. 1. p.176, which reads
2 CONC : "At a court held December 3,1645, Stephen Metcalfe complayned that he
2 CONC , going into thehowse of Jo h n Linley, Francis Linley, his brother, be
2 CONC ingin the howse, told him he would sell him a gunne. The saidStephen as
2 CONC ked him if it were a good one. He answered, 'Yea,as any was in the town
2 CONC e.' Whereupon they bargained, andStephen was to give hi m sev enteen sh
2 CONC illings. As Stephenwas going out of dores, he questioned the sufficienc
2 CONC y of thelocke. Francis told him, 'Indeed, John Nash told me she wasnot w
2 CONC orth threepence, butfor my my part, I do not vallew itworse for that. S
2 CONC mithes do no t effec t old gunnes, for Iknew one gunne which John Nash d
2 CONC ispraised which is a goodone for all that.'
2 CONT Soe, Stephen went home and afterwards discharging the saidgunne, thebri
2 CONC ch flew out and struck into his eye andwounded him deep and dangerously i
2 CONC nto the head. FrancisLinley pleaded that he told Stephen that John Nash t
2 CONC old himthat the gunn e wa s naught, that it was not worththreepence, th
2 CONC at the barrell was thinne and would not bare anew britch, and advised S
2 CONC tephen to scoure her well, and ifhe tried her, to put but a little char
2 CONC ge in her. Mr. Gregsonand John Nash testified tha t whe n he was examin
2 CONC ed beforeMr. Gregson, Francis Linley denied he told Stephen that thebar
2 CONC rell was thinne and would not bare a new britch,that itwas crackt on on
2 CONC e side from the britch to the touch hole.John Nash testified that he to
2 CONC uld Fran ci s it was a verynaughty piece, not worth mendinge, and yet h
2 CONC e prest him tomend it as well as he could and let it be as it will. Het
2 CONC old him moreover that the barrell at the britch was as thinas a shillin
2 CONC g, crackt from the britch to the touc h hol e,and would not beare a bri
2 CONC tch; and after he had mended it,told him he would not give three pence f

2 CONC , "She hadmischieved his dog g & and that they would doe it to a doggwo
2 CONC uld do it to himselfe & family so yft he should be afraidto goe out of h
2 CONC is house without company, and that he wouldremove his dwelling for her.
2 CONC " Did he just accuse her ofhaving sex with a dog or actin g like one? I
2 CONC t John was fined5£. It must have been pretty nasty because he beganmaki
2 CONC ng arrangments to leave Guilford within a week. A monthlater, however, i

1 NOTE Our Family Origin and Name per David Lindsley's (citing'Connecticut Lin
2 CONC sley - The Six Johns'; John M. Lindley andRay Keyes Linsley) notes:
2 CONT "What really interest us today, is that the references givenour name sh
2 CONC ow that Lindley was a name of a location. Lindwas Old English for the l
2 CONC ime tree, was so used by Chaucer,and Ley or Lea, was a field. So the na
2 CONC me Lindley, means TheLimetre e Field, andwas very likey applied to a ma
2 CONC n wholived in a field of Lime Trees and was applied to a numberof local
2 CONC ities in England. John M. Lindley showed two inYorkshire, one in Shrops
2 CONC hire, and one in Wiltshire, in thelong ago days, and ther e wereothers l
2 CONC ater.
2 CONT From: Connecticut Linsley - The Six Johns, quoting aparagraph from the L
2 CONC indley Book by John M. LindleyAnd fromHenry Ellis' introductions to Dom
2 CONC esday Book, we learn thatas early as 1086 under William the Conqueror, t
2 CONC here wereLindleys mentioned, but none seem to appear before that. Andfr
2 CONC om that date down the years the name in various spelling sappear in var
2 CONC ious parts of England,but Yorkshire appears tohave been the original ho
2 CONC me. Some from here were givenhighrank, and a coat of arms. Some of the l
2 CONC ines died out, andwith the many changes in spelling, it is very questio
2 CONC nabl eas to who is who today.
2 CONT We find in England, Lynley, Linllies, Lyndsley, Lindly,Lindley, Linley, L
2 CONC indsey, Lindsay, Linsey, etc. Are theseall the same family? It may well b
2 CONC e questioned, but on thisside we find as many and we find statements th
2 CONC at familieshere change d , because someone thought a certain spellingwa
2 CONC s right, and others as they wanted to bedifferent, so itis very hard no
2 CONC w to say what was correct 900 years ago.
2 CONT By the year 1639, when our ancestor is reported as coming toConnecticut
2 CONC , the name inmany spellings are not much likethe Lindley, we may questi
2 CONC on if they are related. Lindsay issaid to be an entirely different name
2 CONC . It may be only amisspelling .
2 CONT So it became a question as to what part of England John andFrancis (his b
2 CONC rother) came from. Two historians of earlyConnecticut, Cothren and Atwa
2 CONC ter disagree. The first saysfrom southwest of London, the other northwe
2 CONC st. I have a copyof a lett e r by Joel Lindsley, a descendant of Franci
2 CONC s,written in 1896, in which he states it as his belief theycame from Co
2 CONC unty Durham, away in the north of England, andAtwater in his early New H
2 CONC aven history, believes that Johncame with Henry Witfield ' s company in 1
2 CONC 639 and settled inGuilford. This company was largely from Kent, Sussex, a
2 CONC ndSurry, all in the south of England, but he did have somefrom other pa
2 CONC rts, Cambridgeshire, Huntingtonshire,Leicestershire, and London, and pe
2 CONC rhaps others .
2 CONT Unfortunately, our John and Francis were not important enoughto be reco
2 CONC rded as some were. But we know certain facts fromrecords onthis side to w
2 CONC hich any comers from the other sidemust fit to be John and Francis. And i
2 CONC n my efforts to dig upfa c ts, many records from various parts of Engla
2 CONC nd showthey cannot apply to our John and Francis. However, I havefound o
2 CONC ne family that maybe. I do not say it is. I say onlyit maybe. John and F
2 CONC rancis were very common names among thefamily in ol d En gland. Thomas a
2 CONC nd Richard seemed tobeperhaps among the first mentioned and were also v
2 CONC ery common.So wherever we look for records, we find these names, alsoRa
2 CONC lph, Phillip, William, George, and Christopher.
2 CONT It is my belief John and Francis may have come from Althorpein Lincolns
2 CONC hire, as from all facts I can so far get, theyseem to disappear there, a
2 CONC nd appear here, and all seems tofit into one picture. But there seems s
2 CONC till to be lackingthe actu a l record to show they are the same boys.

1 NOTE These notes are from information sent by James Ted Hammer; this version s
2 CONC howing William E. Barnard as father to Thomas B. Barnard born 1612:
2 CONT
2 CONT Barnard is a French and English variation of the surname Bernard, which h
2 CONC as origins among the English,French,Polish, and Czechs, and is derived f
2 CONC rom the Germanic given name Bernhard, from the elements ber=bear+hard=b
2 CONC rave,hardy. The name was introduced to England by the conquering Norman
2 CONC s in 1066 (that was the date William won the battle;the name might have b
2 CONC een introduced a day or two later.) Another source states that the surn
2 CONC ame "BARNARD" comes from the Saxon "bearn" or "bairn" which means,'a ch
2 CONC ild-like disposition; and "ard", meaning nature'.
2 CONT
2 CONT Mary Barnard published a book on Nantucket Barnard's-Nantucket Genesis. T
2 CONC he big question is where the brothers Robert and Thomas come from and w
2 CONC ho was their father,William Barnard or Thomas Barnard Sr. She was unabl
2 CONC e to solve that problem.They both are apparently in Nantucket in the 16
2 CONC 40's or earlier. These two questions have vexed Barnard genealogists fo
2 CONC r some time.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas B Barnard waas born about 1580, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England
2 CONC , and died about 1677. Thomas married Margery Arnold on May 26, 1603, i
2 CONC n Ilchester, Somersetshire, England. She was bornh on August 30, 1581, i
2 CONC n Ilchester, Somersetshire, England and died on August 1, 1785, in Engl
2 CONC and.
2 CONT
2 CONT Others list the parents of Thomas and Robert Barnard as William E Barna
2 CONC rd and Emily Nye of Branstone, Essex County,England.
2 CONT
2 CONT I have chosen to show William Barnard and dEmily Nye to be their parent
2 CONC s because in the vital records of Essex, the estate papers of Robert Ba
2 CONC rnard's brother, Thomas B Barnard, Sr., specifically lists him as "Sr".
2 CONC I am assuming that if he carried the same name as his father he would h
2 CONC ave been called,"Jr" or "II".
2 CONT
2 CONT Even though James Hammer shows William E. as the father of Robert and T
2 CONC homas I use Thomas B. as the primary and have also listeed William and E
2 CONC mily as possible parents.
2 CONT
2 CONT Another researcher who also shows William E as the father of Thomas is:

2 CONC f the ladies doing Barnard research says she had research done on the W
2 CONC iltshire Barnards, but there was no way to tie them into the young men w
2 CONC ho emigrated to the colonies. She says a stronger case is made that the p
2 CONC arents were Thomas and Ann (Cooke) Barnard of Suffolk Co.,England. Patr
2 CONC icia Burns has done extensive research, and this line seems to be the m
2 CONC ost valid one.

2 CONT Ezra Cornell (Alonzo's father) was an associate of Samuel F.B. Morse (M

2 CONT
2 CONT These notes are from information sent by James Ted Hammer; this version s
2 CONC howing William E. Barnard as father to Thomas B. Barnard born 1612:
2 CONT
2 CONT Barnard is a French and English variation of the surname Bernard, which h
2 CONC as origins among the English,French,Polish, and Czechs, and is derived f
2 CONC rom the Germanic given name Bernhard, from the elements ber=bear+hard=b
2 CONC rave,hardy. The name was introduced to England by the conquering Norman
2 CONC s in 1066 (that was the date William won the battle;the name might have b
2 CONC een introduced a day or two later.) Another source states that the surn
2 CONC ame "BARNARD" comes from the Saxon "bearn" or "bairn" which means,'a ch
2 CONC ild-like disposition; and "ard", meaning nature'.
2 CONT
2 CONT Mary Barnard published a book on Nantucket Barnard's-Nantucket Genesis. T
2 CONC he big question is where the brothers Robert and Thomas come from and w
2 CONC ho was their father,William Barnard or Thomas Barnard Sr. She was unabl
2 CONC e to solve that problem.They both are apparently in Nantucket in the 16
2 CONC 40's or earlier. These two questions have vexed Barnard genealogists fo
2 CONC r some time.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas B Barnard waas born about 1580, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England
2 CONC , and died about 1677. Thomas married Margery Arnold on May 26, 1603, i
2 CONC n Ilchester, Somersetshire, England. She was bornh on August 30, 1581, i
2 CONC n Ilchester, Somersetshire, England and died on August 1, 1785, in Engl
2 CONC and.
2 CONT
2 CONT Others list the parents of Thomas and Robert Barnard as William E Barna
2 CONC rd and Emily Nye of Branstone, Essex County,England.
2 CONT
2 CONT I have chosen to show William Barnard and Emily Nye to be their parents b
2 CONC ecause in the vital records of Essex, the estate papers of Robert Barna
2 CONC rd's brother, Thomas B Barnard, Sr., specifically lists him as "Sr".I a
2 CONC m assuming that if he carried the same name as his father he would have b
2 CONC een called,"Jr" or "II".
2 CONT
2 CONT Even though James Hammer shows William E. as the father of Robert and T
2 CONC homas, I use Thomas B. as the primary and have also listed William and E

2 CONC as one of the founders of Amesbury. He was one of the signators of "Ati
2 CONC cles of Agreement", between inhabitants of "Old Town" and "New Town" on M
2 CONC ay 1754, in company of Thomas Macy, John Severance and others. He trans
2 CONC ferred half his share to his brother Robert and his son Nathaniel repre

2 CONT Also Information from Essex Vital Records CD by Sandi Goetze and also H
2 CONC ampton Quarterly Records;Vol.2 page 76.
2 CONT
2 CONT All this below is from Grandpa Frank Barnard:
2 CONT
2 CONT The Barnard Family were Quakers that came from England in the late 1630
2 CONC 's. Two brothers came and we are related to both. The daughter of one m
2 CONC arried the son of the other. Some six generations later, Matilda Barnar
2 CONC d married Henry Canaday in Guilford Co.,North Carolina in 1796.
2 CONT
2 CONT Matilda's parents were Benjamin Barnard and Eunice Fitch. Through Eunic
2 CONC e Fitch Barnard's mother, we are related to John Howland and Elizabeth T
2 CONC illey. Both of whom arrived in America at Plymouth,Massachusetts aboard t
2 CONC he MAYFLOWER in 1622.
2 CONT
2 CONT The family was Quaker. They began living in Andover and Amesbury, north o
2 CONC f Boston, but soon moved to the island of Nantucket. From there they mi
2 CONC grated to new Quaker communities in central North Carolina and it was t
2 CONC here that they became a part of the Canaday Family.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas was the elder of the two brothers. He was born about 1612 in Eng
2 CONC land. Some sources hint he was from Brandstone Parish in either Suffolk o
2 CONC r Essex. However, researchers have not been able to find any proof in t
2 CONC he registers of either parish. We may assume he and his brother were En
2 CONC glish, but as of now I do not exactly know where they lived.
2 CONT
2 CONT Again may sources state the brothers came to America in 1650. Yet Thoma
2 CONC s is shown on an old map as being a landholder in Salisbury, Massachuse
2 CONC tts in 1639. Later the family also bought land a few miles away in neig
2 CONC hboring Amesbury, Massachusetts.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas seems to have had lands in both Salisbury and Amesbury. The chil
2 CONC dren were all born in Salisbury, but he appears in early Amesbury recor
2 CONC ds by 1660 and then in the records of both towns(  NP, I am of the unde
2 CONC rstanding that Salisbury and Amesbury are one and the same, that they c
2 CONC hanged Amesbury to Salsbury). Perhaps all the lands lay on the border a
2 CONC nd spilled over into both towns.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas was one of the original purchasers of Nantucket Island in 1659. H
2 CONC e gave ahalf interest to his brother Robert. It does not appear that he e
2 CONC ver went to the island, but Robert did in 1663.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas was killed by Indians in Amesbury in October of 1667. His estate w
2 CONC as settled in 1679. Eleanor Barnard remained in the area and on July 19
2 CONC , 1681 she married George Little of Newbury.

1 NOTE He was thought to be a Quaker as was his son John, and daughter Mary.He w
2 CONC as a "husbandman".Robert Barnard is buried in Nantucket. He first appea
2 CONC red in Salisbury,MA. sometime in 1639/1640, then moved to Andover, MA. i
2 CONC n 1644 until late in 1663 when he moved to Nantucket.
2 CONT
2 CONT He was born in England and came to New England with twelve or more of t
2 CONC he same surname between 1634 and 1640. He was one of the founders of th
2 CONC e church in Andover, MA in 1645. Thomas and Robert Barnard are listed a
2 CONC s partners in a journal of the first settling of Nantucket Island. Robe
2 CONC rt died in 1682 Nantucket, MA.
2 CONT
2 CONT Below from Barnard internet site:Jayne McCarley; jaymccarley@prodigy.co
2 CONC m
2 CONT
2 CONT Robert is " reported" by some researchers to be the brother of Thomas B
2 CONC arnard of Amesbury. No proof of this has been found, but is generally a
2 CONC ccepted by Barnard researchers because of Robert's nomination by Thomas t
2 CONC o be one of the founders of Nantucket.
2 CONT
2 CONT On arriving from England, Thomas settled in Amesbury but Robert first s
2 CONC hows up in Salisbury, MA with the recording of his son John's birth. It i
2 CONC s thought that he, Robert, was "under age" when they first arrived and c
2 CONC ould not obtain "freeman" status and so does not show any records. Ther
2 CONC e is no record in Salisbury of his marriage, or in the area that he own
2 CONC ed land or was a church member.
2 CONT
2 CONT The next record of Robert is found in Andover, where he is one of the f
2 CONC ounders of the town and church.Thomas rec. a share as one of the ten or
2 CONC iginal proprietors of Nantucket and as such was privileged to vote a ne
2 CONC w member.Thomas voted Robert Barnard of Andover, but in his nomination i
2 CONC t was not stated that Thomas was his brother.
2 CONT
2 CONT Robert removed to Nantucket but Thomas remained in Amesbury and sent hi
2 CONC s son Nathaniel to Nantucket in his place. It is also, "believed but no
2 CONC t proven", that Nathaniel married Robert's daughter, Mary.It appears th
2 CONC at Thomas never lived in Nantucket, but remained in Amesbury and died t
2 CONC here as his will states he is of Amesbury.
2 CONT
2 CONT The parentage of Robert of Andover and Thomas Barnard of Amesbury has n
2 CONC ot been proven. There have been several "genealogies" about the family t
2 CONC hat state their parentage, but at this time "NONE" of them have proven o
2 CONC ut. Research in England is still continuing.
2 CONT
2 CONT Here are two books that might be helpful:
2 CONT
2 CONT Nantucket Landfall- Author: Dorothy C.A. Blanchard, Dodd, Mead & Compan
2 CONC y, New York. 1956 A subtitle is " The story of an island's sea change f
2 CONC rom whaling port to summer resort."
2 CONT "The Early Settlers of Nantucket" by Lydia S. Hinchman, which still is i
2 CONC n print.
2 CONT
2 CONT The following is from Grandpa Frank Barnard:
2 CONT Robert was the younger brother and was born in England in 1614. He, lik
2 CONC e his brother, setled first in Salisbury about 1640. By about 1645 he h
2 CONC ad moved further inland to Andover,MA.
2 CONT
2 CONT The family remained in the Aandover area until 1663, when Robert and mo
2 CONC st of his family moved to Nantucket Island. One son,Stephen, remained o
2 CONC n the land in Andover.
2 CONT
2 CONT Robert and his family were early settlers and planters on Nantucket. He r
2 CONC emained there until his death in 1682. He apparentloy still had claims i
2 CONC n Aaandover when he died intestate. In 1714 his grandson Robert was app
2 CONC ointed as administrator in some claim action the state had against  his e
2 CONC state in Andover. Joanna Barnard lived on many years and died on Nantuc
2 CONC ket on March 31, 1705

2 CONT The surname Harvey (also spelled Harvie) is an ancient Norman personal n
2 CONC ame which has been adopted as a family designation. Harvey is either de
2 CONC rived from the Celtic "Houerf" meaning "bitter" the name gradually chan
2 CONC ging to Houerv, Herve, and later Hervey, Harvie, Harvey or it is derive
2 CONC d from the germanic "Herewig" meaning "Land (War) Warrior" coming from B
2 CONC rittany to England with the Normans. Osbert de Hervey is styled in the R
2 CONC egister of St Edmundsbury as the son of Hervey. From him according to t
2 CONC he Peerage, sprang the Herveys and Harveys, enobled in in England and I
2 CONC reland and also from the resemblance of the Arms, the Herveys and Harve
2 CONC ys of Aberdeenshire and other parts of Scotland.
2 CONT The origin of the Harvey family can be traced back to Geoffry III Visco
2 CONC unt of Bourgs (11th Century) in France. His grandson Herveus de Bourges a
2 CONC ccompanied William the Conqueror to England and in 1086 held a large Ba
2 CONC rony in Suffolk. His son was Henry Fitz Hervey. Osbert Fitz (de) Hervey w
2 CONC as one of the King's Justices in the 12th Century. William Herveus of t
2 CONC he same family a landholder in Normandy emigrated to Surrey in England i
2 CONC n 1198. Herve de Leon a descendant of Robert Fitz Harvey who came to En
2 CONC gland with William the Conqueror removed to Ireland in 1171. He is the p
2 CONC rogenitor of the old and prominent Irish Families bearing the surname H
2 CONC arvey (Harvie).
2 CONT From Henry a son of Harvey of Montmarsh probably a descendant of Herveu
2 CONC s descended John Harvey of Risley who was Knight of the shire of County B
2 CONC edford in 1386. He had two sons, John and Peter from whom descended the N
2 CONC orthamptonshire Harveys. From John are descended the Marquises of Brist
2 CONC ol as well as the Baronets of Bathurst and the Harveys of Cole Park in C
2 CONC ounty Wilts. Several families bearing the surname Harvey and descended f
2 CONC rom John Hervey of County Bedford settled in Somersetshire. It is relat
2 CONC ed that the above family, Turner Harvey born 1485 son of Humphrey Harve
2 CONC y was the mightiest man in all England with the longbow. Because of his s
2 CONC trength and skill with the bow and bravery in battle, Turner became a f
2 CONC avorite henchman of Henry VIII. Tradition states that at his death, no m
2 CONC an could spring Turner's bow. Turner's son William was the owner of the c
2 CONC astle and manor of Bridgewater. William was appointed by Queen Mary, Cl
2 CONC arencieux King-Of-Arms, a position of honor. Thomas (1585-1647), a grea
2 CONC t grandson of Turner and a younger brother of Henry, the owner of Bridg
2 CONC ewater Manor, lived in Ashill in Somersetshire. Thomas had issue daughe
2 CONC r unknown; James born 1612; William; Thomas. His daughter amd sons Will
2 CONC iam and Thomas emigrated to America. Turner's brother William Harvey se
2 CONC ttled in Folkstone, Kent. William's grandson Thomas had seven sons and t
2 CONC wo daughters. One of his sons was Dr. William Harvey famos as the disco
2 CONC verer of the circulation of blood. His father was second cousin to Thom
2 CONC as Harvey of Ashill and Dr. Harvey was therefore related to the emigran
2 CONC ts to America, William and Thomas.
2 CONT *Source:  A Harvey Study, 1957REFN: 19343
2 CONT Richard Harvey of Brockley, described as "son and heir of Humphrey Harv
2 CONC ey," was the eldest child of the latter, whose youngest son was TURNER H
2 CONC ARVEY, who was born about 1485, and, according to tradition and the "Re
2 CONC miniscences of the Harvey Family," became a noted archer and warrior.
2 CONT It is recorded in these "Reminiscenses," and in certain family document
2 CONC s, that in his time "Turner Harvey was the mightiest man with the longb
2 CONC ow in all England, and that at his death there was no man in the countr
2 CONC y who could spring his bow." Because of his remarkable strength, his sk
2 CONC ill with the bow, and his bravery in battle, it is said that Turner bec
2 CONC ame a favorite henchman of his Lord the King, Henry VIII. And it is fur
2 CONC ther related that once, after a very sanguinary battle which ended in t
2 CONC he capture by the King's soldiers of an important fortified town, Turne
2 CONC r, who had been in the hottest places during the battle and had fought v
2 CONC aliantly and effectively, was found to be missing by the King who was t
2 CONC here in personal command of his soldiers.
2 CONT Renowned Archer and Warrior who fought for Henry the VIII.

2 CONT The surname Harvey (also spelled Harvie) is an ancient Norman personal n
2 CONC ame which has been adopted as a family designation. Harvey is either de
2 CONC rived from the Celtic "Houerf" meaning "bitter" the name gradually chan
2 CONC ging to Houerv, Herve, and later Hervey, Harvie, Harvey or it is derive
2 CONC d from the germanic "Herewig" meaning "Land (War) Warrior" coming from B
2 CONC rittany to England with the Normans. Osbert de Hervey is styled in the R
2 CONC egister of St Edmundsbury as the son of Hervey. From him according to t
2 CONC he Peerage, sprang the Herveys and Harveys, enobled in in England and I
2 CONC reland and also from the resemblance of the Arms, the Herveys and Harve
2 CONC ys of Aberdeenshire and other parts of Scotland.
2 CONT The origin of the Harvey family can be traced back to Geoffry III Visco
2 CONC unt of Bourgs (11th Century) in France. His grandson Herveus de Bourges a
2 CONC ccompanied William the Conqueror to England and in 1086 held a large Ba
2 CONC rony in Suffolk. His son was Henry Fitz Hervey. Osbert Fitz (de) Hervey w
2 CONC as one of the King's Justices in the 12th Century. William Herveus of t
2 CONC he same family a landholder in Normandy emigrated to Surrey in England i
2 CONC n 1198. Herve de Leon a descendant of Robert Fitz Harvey who came to En
2 CONC gland with William the Conqueror removed to Ireland in 1171. He is the p
2 CONC rogenitor of the old and prominent Irish Families bearing the surname H
2 CONC arvey (Harvie).
2 CONT From Henry a son of Harvey of Montmarsh probably a descendant of Herveu
2 CONC s descended John Harvey of Risley who was Knight of the shire of County B
2 CONC edford in 1386. He had two sons, John and Peter from whom descended the N
2 CONC orthamptonshire Harveys. From John are descended the Marquises of Brist
2 CONC ol as well as the Baronets of Bathurst and the Harveys of Cole Park in C
2 CONC ounty Wilts. Several families bearing the surname Harvey and descended f
2 CONC rom John Hervey of County Bedford settled in Somersetshire. It is relat
2 CONC ed that the above family, Turner Harvey born 1485 son of Humphrey Harve
2 CONC y was the mightiest man in all England with the longbow. Because of his s
2 CONC trength and skill with the bow and bravery in battle, Turner became a f
2 CONC avorite henchman of Henry VIII. Tradition states that at his death, no m
2 CONC an could spring Turner's bow. Turner's son William was the owner of the c
2 CONC astle and manor of Bridgewater. William was appointed by Queen Mary, Cl
2 CONC arencieux King-Of-Arms, a position of honor. Thomas (1585-1647), a grea
2 CONC t grandson of Turner and a younger brother of Henry, the owner of Bridg
2 CONC ewater Manor, lived in Ashill in Somersetshire. Thomas had issue daughe
2 CONC r unknown; James born 1612; William; Thomas. His daughter amd sons Will
2 CONC iam and Thomas emigrated to America. Turner's brother William Harvey se
2 CONC ttled in Folkstone, Kent. William's grandson Thomas had seven sons and t
2 CONC wo daughters. One of his sons was Dr. William Harvey famos as the disco
2 CONC verer of the circulation of blood. His father was second cousin to Thom
2 CONC as Harvey of Ashill and Dr. Harvey was therefore related to the emigran
2 CONC ts to America, William and Thomas.
2 CONT *Source:  A Harvey Study, 1957
2 CONT There were Anglo-Norman Harveys in Surrey as early as the beginning of t
2 CONC he thirteenth century. In Kent there were Harveys settled at Eythorne e
2 CONC arly in the fifteenth century, and later at Eastry and Cowden--all spru
2 CONC ng from the same stock; and at about the beginning of the sixteenth cen
2 CONC tury William Harvey, son of Humphrey and brother of Turner, was settled a
2 CONC t Folkestone in Kent. It is quite probable that Humphrey Harvey was ori
2 CONC ginally of Kent--but this cannot now be determined.
2 CONT William Harvey of Folkestone, above mentioned, had a son Thomas, who ha
2 CONC d a son Thomas (b. about 1550; d. 12 Jan., 1623), who, in the latter pa
2 CONC rt of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was described as a "yeoman of Folks
2 CONC tone in Kent." He was married (1st) to (???) Jenkins, and (2d) to Joane
2 CONC , daughter of Thomas Halke, who bore him seven sons and two daughters.
2 CONT The eldest of these nine children was Dr. William Harvey (b. at Folkest
2 CONC one 1 April 1578), noted as the discoverer of the circulation of the bl
2 CONC ood. He was cotemporaneous with Thomas Harvey of Ayshill [Ashill],  the
2 CONC ir fathers being second cousins. Doctor Harvey died 3 June, 1657, witho
2 CONC ut issue.
2 CONT Prior to the reign of Henry VIII. (which began A. D. 1509) several fami
2 CONC lies bearing the name Harvey, and said to be descended from a common an
2 CONC cestor, were settled in Somersetshire,(+) England; in which county at t
2 CONC hat time many manors were held (according to Domesday Book) under and b
2 CONC y virtue of grants made by William the Conqueror to his brother Robert E
2 CONC arl of Morton, and to others of the King's Norman followers. [See "The H
2 CONC istory and Antiquities of the County of Somerset," by the Rev. John Col
2 CONC linson, Bath, 1791.]

2 CONT William was born in Somersetshire, England, about 1614. Accompanied by h

2 CONC nd in the following Spring the second marriage took place. It was that o
2 CONC f William Harvey, and is recorded upon the court records of New Plymout
2 CONC h thus: "At a Court of Assistants William Harvey and Joane Hucker of Co
2 CONC hannet were maryed the 2 of Aprill 1639."
2 CONT In the latter part of 1639, or early in 1640, William Harvey and his wi
2 CONC fe removed to Boston, where they remained until 1646--during which peri
2 CONC od four children were born to them. [See The N.E. Hist. & Gen. Reg., H.
2 CONC : 189, and VIII.: 38, 350.] The family then returned to Taunton.
2 CONT -------
2 CONT William was born in Somersetshire, England, about 1614. Accompanied by h
2 CONC is brother Thomas he came to America in 1636, and settled at Dorchester
2 CONC . In 1637 he was one of the company of forty-six "first and ancient pur
2 CONC chasers," so called, who, "feeling much straitened for want of room," p
2 CONC urchased from Massasoit , the chief sachem of the Wampanoag tribe of In
2 CONC dians, whose seat was at Mount Hope, the Indian title to Cohannet, lyin
2 CONC g thirty-two miles south of Boston, in the colony of New Plymouth. The g
2 CONC reat immigration into New England under the Massachusetts Bay charter, w
2 CONC hich began in 1630, continued for a period of ten years or more, or unt
2 CONC il the cessation in England of persecution for non-conformity. It is es
2 CONC timated by Hutchinson, the eminent historian of the Massa chusetts Colo
2 CONC ny, that during this period 20,000 persons came to these shores. "It wa
2 CONC s not the peasantry of Great Britain, nor her paupers, nor her fortune h
2 CONC unters that founded New England. It was her staunch yeomanry, her intel
2 CONC ligent mechanics, her merchants, her farmers, her middle classes--and o
2 CONC f devout women not a few--whose enlarged vision beheld a realm of freed
2 CONC om beyond the ocean, and whose independent spirits disdained the yoke o
2 CONC f oppression, were it to be imposed either on the soul or the body."

2 CONC s, " pro-pritors" [See original deed in possession of the Old Colony Hi

2 CONT =============================================================
2 CONT Note.-- I deem it proper and necessary, at this point, to make some ref
2 CONC erences to a genealogy of certain branches of the Harvey family to be f
2 CONC ound in a "History of Sutton, New Hampshire," published a few years ago b
2 CONC y Mrs. Auguata Harvey Worthen.
2 CONT The author says (page 745): " Thomas and William Harvey, brothers, were i
2 CONC n this country previous to 1640. Thomas married in 1643 Elizabeth, daug
2 CONC hter of James Wall, of Hampton, and resided in Hampton and Amesbury. Wi
2 CONC lliam married Joan ______. and in 1639 was living in Plymouth. He remov
2 CONC ed to Taunton. * * *
2 CONT "Children by first wife :

2 CONT "iv.   Joseph, b. 14 Dec., 1645.     [Should be 8.  He was baptized the 1
2 CONC 4th.]
2 CONT "His wife Joan died in 1649, and he married, 2nd, Martha Slocum, sister t
2 CONC o Anthony Slocum. * * *
2 CONT "Children by second wife :
2 CONT "  v.   William, b. 27 Aug., 1651.
2 CONT " vi.   Thomas, b. 16 Aug., 1652.
2 CONT "vii.   John, b. Feby., 1655.
2 CONT "William the father died 15 Aug., 1658, and his widow married Henry Tew
2 CONC ksbury 10 Nov., 1659. It is believed that (vi.) Thomas and (vii.) John a
2 CONC re the Thomas and John Harvey found on the early Amesbury records. * * F
2 CONC rom (vii.) john Harvey the descent is clearly traced to the Harveys of N
2 CONC ottingham, Nortwood,Warner and Sutton [New Hampshire}." * * * *
2 CONT It is very certain, I think, that the Thomas first named by Mrs. Worthe
2 CONC n, and who married Elizabeth Wall, was not the Thomas who was settled a
2 CONC t Cohannet or Taunton in 1638, and was not the brother of Wil- liam who "
2 CONC married Joan " [Hucker].
2 CONT As we have shown on page 28 ante, William, the first, resided at Cohann
2 CONC et, and not at Plymouth when he was married in 1639 to Joane Hucker; an
2 CONC d soon thereafter he and his wife removed temporarily to Boston, where w
2 CONC ithin the next six years four of their five children were born. They th
2 CONC en returned to Taunton, where in 1647 their fifth child was born. The w
2 CONC hole family continued to reside in Taunton for many years.
2 CONT Mrs. Worthen says William's wife Joane died in 1649 and he married (2nd
2 CONC ) Martha Slocum. She bases this statement, without doubt, upon what Sav
2 CONC age says in his "Genealogical Dictionary," viz. : "And it is sup- posed t
2 CONC he same man [i. e., William of Boston, 1640-'5, whose wife was Joane] b
2 CONC y wife Martha had :
2 CONT William, b. 27 Aug., 1651.
2 CONT Thomas (again), * b. 16 Aug., 1652.
2 CONT John, b. Feby., 1655.
2 CONT *ii. Thomas, b. 18 Dec., 1641, son of William and Joanna (Hucker) Harve
2 CONC y, was alive at this date, and it is hardly probable that another son w
2 CONC ould be named Thomas when there was already one bearing that name among t
2 CONC he children of the family.
2 CONT The facts in the case are these : In 1650 there was residing in Boston a c
2 CONC ertain William Harvey, who was married in that year to Martha Copp, dau
2 CONC ghter of William Copp, of Boston, cordwainer. They became the parents o
2 CONC f four children : i. William, b. 27 Aug., 1651; ii. Thomas, b. 16 Aug .
2 CONC , 1652; iii. John, b. 5 Feby., 1654; iv. Mary, b. 1656 or'7. In 1654 th
2 CONC e first three of these children were baptized in Boston. [See "Report o
2 CONC f the Record Comsrs. of Boston," pp. 46 and 49.]
2 CONT William the father died 15 Aug., 1658. [See "Report of Record Comsrs., p
2 CONC . 66.] His widow, Martha maried Henry Tewksbury, 10 Nov., 1659. [See "R
2 CONC eport of Record Comsrs., p. 72.]
2 CONT William Copp, father of Martha (Copp, Harvey) Tewksbury, died in 1662, a
2 CONC nd his will was probated 31 October. He named therein his "daughter Tew
2 CONC ksbury" and grandchildren William, Thomas, John and Mary Harvey. [See N
2 CONC ew England Hist. & Gen. Reg., XLV111. : 459]
2 CONT In commenting upon the will of Agnes Clark (mentioned on page 29 ante) t
2 CONC he editor of the N.E. Hist & Gen. Reg. said (Vol. XLV1., p. 453) : "Sav
2 CONC age gives two persons by the name of William Harvey who were then [1647
2 CONC ] in New England. One was of Boston and had by wife Joane * * *. A pers
2 CONC on of this name, probably the same, by wife Martha had * * *. The other W
2 CONC illiam was of Plymouth [sic?[; married Joanna,, 1639; removed to Taunto
2 CONC n. Query : May not the Plymouth man be the same as the Boston man, and t
2 CONC he Taunton man be a different person?"
2 CONT I think it is very clearly proved by the public records herein referred t
2 CONC o, and by other records, that there was no William Harvey residing at P
2 CONC lymouth in 1639, and that the two Williams "then in New England" were : (
2 CONC 1) William of Taunton, whose wife was Joanna Hucker, and (2) William of B
2 CONC oston, who married Martha Copp.

2 CONT ---------------
2 CONT WILLIAM HARVEY,  (Thomas, 1), was born in Somersetshire, England, about 1
2 CONC 614. Accompanied by his brother Thomas he came to American in 1636, and s
2 CONC ettled at Dorchester. In the 1637 he was one of the company of the fort
2 CONC y-six "first and ancient purchasers, " so called, who, "feeling much st
2 CONC raitened for want of room", purchased from Massasoit, the chief sachem o
2 CONC f the Wampanoag tribe of Indians, whose seat was Mount Hope, the Indian t
2 CONC itle to Cohannet, lying thirty-two miles south of Boston, in the colony o
2 CONC f New Plymouth.
2 CONT "In the Summer of 1638," says Winthrop, "there came over [from England] t
2 CONC wenty ships and at least 3000 persons, so as they were forced to look o
2 CONC ut new plantations." Thereupon the proprietors of Cohannet removed from D
2 CONC orchester to their new plantation. As a number of these proprietors had c
2 CONC ome to America from the Ancient town of Taunton, and its neighborhood, i
2 CONC n Somersetshire, they gave to their new purchase on the 3 March, 1639, t
2 CONC he name of Taunton -- "in honor and love to our dear native country. ** a
2 CONC nd owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settli
2 CONC ng of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the mi
2 CONC dst of the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterit
2 CONC y after us," as they afterwards declared.*
2 CONT William Harvey's name appears in the list of original proprietors." [Se
2 CONC e Baylies' "Old Colony Memoirs," I.:286.] He was the owner of eight sha
2 CONC res in the new purchase.
2 CONT The first recorded marriage occurred in the new settlement 8 Nov. 1638, a
2 CONC nd in the following Spring the second marriage took place. It was that o
2 CONC f William Harvey, and is recorded upon the court records of New Plymout
2 CONC h thus: " At a Court of Assistants, William Harvey and Joane Hucker of C
2 CONC ohannet were maryed te 2 of Aprill 1639." At that time marriage was qui
2 CONC te an undertaking, since both parties must travel to te town of Plymout
2 CONC h if inhabitants of Plymouth Colony, or to Boston if inhabitants of the M
2 CONC assachusetts Bay Colony, and have the ceremony performed by the Governo
2 CONC r or one of the magistrates.[dagger]
2 CONT ---------------------------------
2 CONT * At a later date, when the Colony of Massachusetts was divided into co
2 CONC unties, another Somersetshire name -- Bristol -- was selected for the c
2 CONC ounty of which Taunton was to be, and is, the sire-town.
2 CONT In the south-western part of this county is the town of Somerset. The a
2 CONC ncient town of Bridgewater (another Somersetshire name with an "e" inse
2 CONC rted in the middle of it) was the first interior settlement in the coun
2 CONC ty of Plymouth, Mass. It adjoined Taunton, was incorporated in 1656, an
2 CONC d embraced within its limits the four towns now known as Bridgewater, N
2 CONC orth, East and West Bridgewater.
2 CONT [dagger] Ministers of the gospel were not allowed to solemnize marriage
2 CONC s in the early colonial days. The Puritans had firmly implanted in the s
2 CONC ocial soil of New England the strict Protestant principle that marriage i
2 CONC s purely a civil rite. Throughout all New England previous to 1680 the m
2 CONC arriage rite was performed by magistrates, or by persons specially empo
2 CONC wered by the colonial authorities. Hutchinson supposes that in Massachu
2 CONC setts there was no instance of a marriage by a clergyman during the exi
2 CONC stence of their first charter-- that is to say, previous to 1684.
2 CONT It was not until 1692 that the Provincial statute provided the "every J
2 CONC ustice of the Peace within the county were he resides, and every settle
2 CONC d Minister in any town, shall and are hereby respectively empowered and a
2 CONC uthorized to solemnize marriages."
2 CONT -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONC ---------
2 CONT In the latter part of 1639, or early in 1640, William Harvey and his wi
2 CONC fe removed to Boston, where they remained until 1646--during which peri
2 CONC od four children were born to them. [See The N.E. Hist & Gen. Reg. II.: 1
2 CONC 89, and VIII.: 38,350.] The family then returned to Taunton.
2 CONT In 1648 William was one of the heirs named in the "will of Agnes Clark o
2 CONC f Ayshill [Ashill], Somerset, widow." The will was executed 20 Oct., 16
2 CONC 47, and proved 10 May, 1648, and from it the following paragraphs have b
2 CONC een taken:
2 CONT * * "I give and bequeath unto William Harvey the son of Thomas Harvey, d
2 CONC eceased, my kinsman now in New England, eighteen pounds, being parcel o
2 CONC f thirty-five pounds which is owing unto me by Richard Parke of Ayshill u
2 CONC pon his bond, which sum is to be paid as soon as it can be recovered, i
2 CONC f he shall come to demand it at nay time within four years, but if he c
2 CONC ome not then my will is that William Harvey the son of James Harvey sha
2 CONC ll have the said money at such time as he shall be of lawful age to giv
2 CONC e a discharge. " I give and bequeath to the said William, son of James H
2 CONC arvey, fifteen pounds parcel of the said thirty-five pounds, when of ag
2 CONC e. * * *
2 CONT "I give and bequeath unto William Harvey in New England all my househol
2 CONC d stuff during his life, if he come to claim it; and after his decease t
2 CONC o remain in the house to the use of James Harvey his brother, and the s
2 CONC aid James to make use of it until William his brother shall come to cla
2 CONC im it." * * * [See "Genealogical Gleanings in England," New Eengl. Hist & G
2 CONC en. Reg., XLVI: 453]
2 CONT "At an orderly town-meeting warned by the constable," and held in Taunt
2 CONC on 28 Dec 1659, it was voted that there should be a general division of l
2 CONC and to every inch and to whom rights of division shall belong"; and it w
2 CONC as agreed that the apportionment should be made upon the following plan
2 CONC : "two acres to the head, * two acres to the shilling, [dagger] and two a
2 CONC cres to the lot.[double dagger]
2 CONT ----------------------------------------
2 CONT * Each member of the family of a proprietor or holder of a right in the p
2 CONC urchase was regarded as a "head". An unmarried man was "to be looked up
2 CONC on as two heads".
2 CONT [dagger] Refers to the tax or rate levied in shillings against every in
2 CONC habitant by the duly appointed "raters" or "listers".
2 CONT [double dagger] The "home" lot which each of the "first purchasers" too
2 CONC k possession of, and which was charged against him as an advancement.
2 CONT -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONC ---------
2 CONT In the list of those who participated in this distribution of Taunton l
2 CONC ands the name of William Harvey appears, and he is charged with at "rat
2 CONC e" of fourteen shillings and credited with seven "heads"--himself, his w
2 CONC ife and five children. According to the plan of apportionment "two acre
2 CONC s to the head" gave him fourteen acres and "two acres to the shilling" t
2 CONC wenty-eight acres. Adding the "two acres to the lot" made a total of fo
2 CONC rty-four acres--which was the quantity of land that William Harvey rece
2 CONC ived. [See "Quarter- Millennial Celebration of Taunton," 1889, p 243.]
2 CONT His "home" lot was on the north side of what is now Cohannet street, be
2 CONC tween what is known as Taunton Green (formerly the town's commons or tr
2 CONC aining-field), and Mill River. A description of the lots is to be found i
2 CONC n Taunton Prop. Rec., IV.: 59,&c.
2 CONT In 1661 William Harvey was Excise Commissioner. [See Plym. Records, XI:
2 CONC 133] In 1664 he was a Representative to the General Court. This latter o
2 CONC ffice he held again in 1677.
2 CONT The law requiring towns in Plymouth Colony to elect selectmen, and givi
2 CONC ng them many judicial powers and duties, was passed in 1665, and the fi
2 CONC rst "Celect Men" chosen in Taunton under that law were William Harvey a
2 CONC nd four others -- who were approved by the General Court 5 June, 1666. [
2 CONC See Plym. Col. Recl, IV.: 124.] In 1666 and '7, and in 1671 and other y
2 CONC ears later, William Harvey was a selectman. 10 Jany, 1669, he was one o
2 CONC f ten men chosen by the town "to draw [up] a list of the purchasers or f
2 CONC ree inhabitants" in Taunton.
2 CONT He was one of a committee of seven appointed 2 Sept., 1672, to manage f
2 CONC or the "free inhabitants" the purchase of a certain tract of land from "
2 CONC Philip, alias Metacum, Chief Sachem," who was the son and successor of M
2 CONC assasoit, heretofore mentioned, and is known in history as King Philip, t
2 CONC he most wily and sagacious Indian of his time. The committee immediatel
2 CONC y attended to their duty and soon obtained from Philip, in consideratio
2 CONC n of £143, a deed for a tract of land "lying three miles along ye Great R
2 CONC iver," and extending westerly four miles.
2 CONT The year 1675 brought with it the gloom and horror of an Indian War. Af
2 CONC ter nearly forty years of quiet, following the vindictive struggle with t
2 CONC he Pequots, the Colonies were terror struck with the news that a wide-s
2 CONC pread combination of Wampanoags, Narragansetts and other tribes of sava
2 CONC ges had been formed under the leadership of King Philip with the design o
2 CONC f exterminating the white race from the land.
2 CONT The first overt act of hostility by Philip was committed on Sunday, Jun
2 CONC e 24, 1675, when several houses were burned and men slaughtered at Swna
2 CONC zey, about twelve miles from Taunton. During the Summer the principal s
2 CONC eat of the war was in the interior of Massachusetts, and from its centr
2 CONC al position Taunton was the chosen rendezvous of the troops from Plymou
2 CONC th, Boston, and elsewhere. For te same reason it was a constant point o
2 CONC f attack by te savages, and several of its dwellings were consumed and t
2 CONC heir inmates butchered. In te Spring of 1676 the danger of the entire d
2 CONC estruction of the village was so imminent that the Cape towns invited t
2 CONC he people of Taunton to take up their abode with them until the war sho
2 CONC uld be ended. The offer was declined in a remarkable letter "subscribed i
2 CONC n the name of the town" by William Harvey and three other inhabitants. T
2 CONC he following paragraphs are from the letter, which is printed in full o
2 CONC n page 325 of the "Quarter-Millennial Celebration of Taunton."
2 CONT * * * "Our sins are already such as might render our friends (did they k
2 CONC now us) afraid to entertain us; and what can we expect as the issue of s
2 CONC uch an addition thereunto, but that the hand of the Lord would follow u
2 CONC s, and find us out wheresoever we fled. * * * The Lord do with us as se
2 CONC emeth good in His sight. Here we have sinned, and here we submit oursel
2 CONC ves to suffer, except the Lord's Providence, and order or advice of Aut
2 CONC horities, should plainly determine us to removal. * * * We are willing, i
2 CONC f it may be judged convenient by you, to secure some of our cattle in y
2 CONC our parts, that they may be no booty or succor to the enemy, if the Lor
2 CONC d spare them so long as that we may have opportunity to convey them, in w
2 CONC hich we desire your speedy advice. And beseeching you not to cease to p
2 CONC ray for us that the Lord would heal our backslidings, and prepare us fo
2 CONC r what measure of the cup of His indignation it may seem good to Him to o
2 CONC rder us to drink." *
2 CONT In March, 1677, "William Harvey of Taunton" received £10 from contribut
2 CONC ions made by "Christians in Ireland" for the relief of those "impoveris
2 CONC hed by the late Indian War."
2 CONT Assonet Neck, a peninsula about two miles long and less than one broad, l
2 CONC ying near Taunton and belonging to the Indians, having been seized by t
2 CONC he Colony to pay the expenses of the Indian Wars, was ordered to be sol
2 CONC d by the General Court in July, 1677. In the following November Constan
2 CONC t Southworth, the Colony Treasurer, conveyed the land to William Harvey a
2 CONC nd five other Taunton men; and in 1682 the tract was annexed to and mad
2 CONC e a part of Taunton.
2 CONT In January, 1678, William Harvey was named as the first member of a com
2 CONC mittee of seven of the inhabitants of Taunton appointed to regulate the s
2 CONC ettlement of lands, and to attend to the confirmation of titles to purc
2 CONC hasers and the ratification of supposed lost grants and town orders.
2 CONT About this period, and during some years later, William's name appears o
2 CONC ften in connection with important affairs of the town; which indicates t
2 CONC hat he continued to be a man of character and influence in the communit
2 CONC y.

2 CONT Others say: Thomas Harvey and Ann Hall
2 CONT Others say: Thomas Harvey and Joan Collier
2 CONT One of the purchasers of the territory which was incorporated March 3, 1
2 CONC 639, under the name of Taunton, in New Plymouth, Anthony Slocum, had ma
2 CONC rried before he left England (???) Harvey, sister of William Harvey. Gi
2 CONC les Slocum (reference #1 below) was born in Somersetshire, England, and d
2 CONC ied in Portsmouth, R. I., 1682. He married Joan (???), who died June, 1
2 CONC 679. Their son:
2 CONT EBENEZER SLOCUM,(ref # 2) born March 25, 1650, and died 1715, married M
2 CONC ary, daughter of Edward and Elizabeth (Mott) Thurston, born February 1, 1
2 CONC 657, and died November 16, 1752.
2 CONT ref #1 = J. O. Austin.
2 CONT ref #2 = Newport Hist. Soc.
2 CONT from " The HARVEY book" page 27:
2 CONT (???) HARVEY,2 daughter of (1) Thomas Harvey, and who was born in Somer
2 CONC setshire about 1610, was married in England to Anthony Slocum, presumab
2 CONC ly of Somersetshire. She came with her husband to America about 1636, a
2 CONC nd it is believed that they settled at Dorchester. Anthony was one of t
2 CONC he forty-six "first and ancient purchasers" in 1637 of Taunton, Mass. [
2 CONC see (4) William Harvey, post], where he resided from 1638 to 1662, when
2 CONC , having united with the Society of Friends, he disposed of his rights i
2 CONC n Taunton and removed with his family to that part of New Plymouth inco
2 CONC rporated later under the name of Dartmouth township. He and one Ralph R
2 CONC ussell were the first settlers there.
2 CONT A fragment of a letter written by Anthony at Dartmouth (the date is tor
2 CONC n off, but it was probably about 1670) to his "brother-in-law William H
2 CONC arvey in Taunton" has been preserved. In it is this paragraph: "My wife a
2 CONC nd sons, and daughter Gilbert who hath four sons, remember our respects a
2 CONC nd loves, and my sons are all married."
