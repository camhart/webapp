	What need does this application meet?
		Genealogists everywhere struggle with current genealogical applications. They 
tend to be behind in their technologies and user interface design, and successful 
research requires many context switches between different pages and views. This 
frustrates genealogists and limits their ability to research because they have to focus 
on the software rather than their research. In addition, many of the leading software 
applications are only Windows compatible, expensive, or both.
