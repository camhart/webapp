Virtual Pedigree™
======

What need does this application meet?
-------------------------------------
Genealogists everywhere struggle with current genealogical applications. They tend to be behind in their technologies and user interface design, and successful research requires many context switches between different pages and views. This frustrates genealogists and limits their ability to research because they have to focus on the software rather than their research. In addition, many of the leading software applications are only Windows compatible, expensive, or both.
Why will anyone want to use it?

Description
-----------
I propose to build a free web compatibility of the current applications. Elastic Paper™ is a new framework for interactive, application for anyone to use that will resolve the constant context switching and lacking seamless GUIs for hierarchical data – perfect for genealogy. The app will allow a user to build their family history and a few basic features that will help them visualize their family history, including Topological Dates™, Pedigree Perspectives™, and a mini-map of their entire recorded genealogy.
